    <h5>&nbsp; &nbsp;I recently left the military as an avionics technician to purse my business adventures, and more of my passions. I currently run my own company HelloSuds, which is based around a unique product I invented. I really enjoy growing the company, but also dream of building a thriving technology business that makes a positive impact on others. I have always loved programming and believe understanding programming will assist me in the larger goals to work for or manage developers to deliver a unique business product to the world.</h5>
